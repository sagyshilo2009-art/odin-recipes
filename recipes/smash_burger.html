       <p> The smash burger is a fan favorite thanks to its crispy edges, juicy center, and bold flavor. Unlike thick burgers, smash burgers are flattened on a hot griddle for maximum browning and a crave-worthy crust. Simple, fast, and absolutely delicious.</p>

       <h3>ingredients list:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250g (1/2 lb) ground beef (80/20 fat ratio is best)</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 burger buns</li>
            <li>2 slices of American cheese (or cheddar)</li>
            <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
            <li>Pickles, lettuce, tomato (optional toppings)</li>
            <li>Butter or oil for the pan</li>
            <li>Burger sauce (optional — recipe below)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Optional Burger Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp mayo</li>
            <li>1 tsp ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tsp mustard</li>
            <li>1 tsp pickle juice or relish</li>
            <li>Mix together and spread on the buns!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the beef into 4 equal balls (don’t overwork them). Keep them cold until cooking.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan or griddle. Butter the inside of the buns and toast until golden. Set aside.</li>
            <li>On a hot skillet or griddle, place 2 beef balls. Use a spatula (with parchment paper or foil) to smash them flat. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for about 2 minutes until the edges are crispy.</li>
            <li>Flip the burgers, add a slice of cheese to each, and cook for another 1–2 minutes until the cheese melts.</li>
            <li>Stack two patties per burger for a double smash. Add to the toasted bun with your favorite toppings and sauce.</li>
            <li>Enjoy with fries, a cold drink, or just by itself — it's that good.</li>
        </ol>
